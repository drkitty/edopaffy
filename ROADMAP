=== Refactor ===

Do a massive refactor so we can get at the actual program logic. This will greatly ease the storage format transition.

=== Change video and playlist information storage format ===

We need two files: videos.json and playlistinfo.json (or something) (old name: playlists.json)

videos.json needs a new format:

[
	{
		"id":STRING,
		"title":STRING,
		"description":STRING,
		"uploader":STRING,
		"downloaded":BOOLEAN,
		"gone":BOOLEAN,
		"playlists": [
			{
				"idOrUrl":STRING,
				"index":NUMBER
			},
			...
		]
	},
	...
]

playlistinfo.json's format is probably fine. We'll see if there's any other info we need to store.

=== Migrate to Python 3, if the Python gdata library ever does ===

2to3 should be sufficient, since we don't really use any wacky stuff.
